# About Me

I'm Dylan Keating, a Senior Data Scientist with a PhD in Physics from McGill University, specializing in computer vision, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning. With experience in both academia and industry, I have led projects in a variety of fields including clinical research, exoplanet science, and deep learning, applying cutting-edge techniques like transformer models and Bayesian predictive models to solve complex problems. My career spans roles in leading tech companies and research institutions, where I have published multiple papers, contributed to patents, and led initiatives to improve data science workflows and MLOps practices.
